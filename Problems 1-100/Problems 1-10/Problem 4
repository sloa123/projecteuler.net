#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#First, let's make a way to determine whether something is a palindrome.

num = int(input("Please type a palindrome: "))

if str(num)[0:int(num/2) + 1] == str(num)[-1:int(-(num/2)):-1]:
  print(num, " is a palindrome.")
else:
  print("Sorry,",num , "is not a palindrome.")
