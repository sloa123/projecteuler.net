#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#First, let's make a way to determine whether something is a palindrome.

##def check_palindrome(num):
##  if str(num)[0:int(num/2) + 1] == str(num)[-1:int(-(num/2)):-1]:
##    return(True)

#Ok, next, let's find a way to systematically run through 3-digit numbers(in reverse preferably)

##999[-1::-1]

#Ok, now put it together
