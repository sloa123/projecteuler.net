#Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

#1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

#By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

a = 0
b = 1
c = 0
d = 0
#a is the previous step
#b is the current step
#c is the running total of what is being asked for in the problem
#d is a placeholder

while b < 4000000:
  if (a + b)%2 == 0:
    c = c + (a + b)
  d = a + b
  a = b
  b = d
print(c)
